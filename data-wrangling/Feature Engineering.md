# Feature Engineering

### Network Architecture
- Input Layer: 15 nodes
- Output Lyer: 8 nodes

### Scalar variables taken straight from analysis:
  - Acousticness
  - Danceability
  - Energy
  - Instrumentalness
  - Liveness
  - Loudness
  - Speechiness
  - Valence

### The hard part:
  - Mode
    - Use dummy variables for input, as interactions with other terms are important (7 total posible values)
    - Not in output layer, but used with key to determine harmonic/consonant transitions
  - Key
    - Use research in computational musicology for output matching (along with mode)
  - Tempo
    - Do not use for input or output of RNN
    - similarity metric is explained below, and is part of matching output feature vector

## Tempo
One of the hardest questions in this project was how to use tempo.  Surely it's an important feature, but how to treat it mathematically was not apparent at first.  I took an approach which expands tempo to two dimensions so that a similarity metric can be calculated as the distance between points. A circle is used to caputre the cyclical nature of tempo similarity.

Here's just the _x_ component graphed against the input (tempo):

A simplified similarity sccore is given by:

Similarity based on tempo ratio for the simplified similarity score is shown below:

Here's what that looks like as a graph of similarity against ratio:

And, in three dimensions, the tempos against each other - with the third dimension shown as a color gradient:
