# Recommender
Ordered recommendations using recurrent nerual networks.

The main focus of this project is a content-based algorithm.

## The Algorithm
1. Body of songs is selected using collaborative matrix completion.
2. Recurrent neural network determines the ideal feature vector for the next song based on the previous sequence of songs.
3. The next song is selected based on minimum cost, which is determined based on the distance from a song to ideal feature vector as well as the consonance of song key transition.
4. Next song is plugged into the RNN and the process repeats from step 2.

## Key Concepts
- Sequence Learning
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Computational Music Theory
- Traveling Salesman Problem

## Neural Network Architecture
- Recurrent
- Unidirectional
- Many-to-one architecture (or a somewhat modified many-to-many)
- tanh or linear activation in hidden layers
- Sigmoid activation in output layer
- GRU is not necessary because long-term dependency is not important.
- Similarly, LSTM is not necessary.
- Conventions:
  - 2 or 3 hidden layers (more than that is quite rare for RNN due to the temporal dimension)
  - Sometimes start with recurrent layers, and _then_ have deep layers.
