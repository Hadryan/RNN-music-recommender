### Outline:
- API Scrape for training set
- Training and evaluation of deep learning model
- Implemented API and functional input/output
- PCA and visualization
- Optional
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Try different distance metrics
  - Key and genre considerations (bias toward same genre, perfect 5ths)
  - Very optional:
    - Combine with collaborative factors
